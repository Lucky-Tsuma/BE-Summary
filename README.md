### 1) HOW THE INTERNET WORKS

**Internet:** global network of computers connected to each other which communicate through a standardized set of protocols. Developed in the late 1960s by the United States Department of Defense as a means of creating a decentralized communication network that could withstand a nuclear attack.

When you send data over the internet, it is broken up into small _packets_ that are sent from your device to a router. The router examines the packet and forwards it to the next router in the path towards its destination.
To ensure that packets are sent and received correctly, the internet uses a variety of protocols e.g:

1.  **Internet Protocol (IP):** responsible for routing packets to their _correct destination_
2.  **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):** ensures that packets are transmitted _reliably and in the correct order._

Other technologies and protocols used to enable communication and data exchange over the internet:

-   Domain Name System (DNS)
-   Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
-   Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) protocol.

#### Terminologies

. _Packet:_ A small unit of data that is transmitted over the internet.
. _Router:_ A ddevice that directs packets between different netorks.
