Internet: global network of computers connected to each other which communicate through a standardized set of protocols. Developed in the late 1960s by the United States Department of Defense as a means of creating a decentralized communication network that could withstand a nuclear attack. 

When you send data over the internet, it is broken up into small packets that are sent from your device to a router. The router examines the packet and forwards it to the next router in the path towards its destination.
To ensure that packets are sent and received correctly, the internet uses a variety of protocols e.g:
 1. Internet Protocol (IP): responsible for routing packets to their correct destination
 2. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): ensures that packets are transmitted reliably and in the correct order.

There are a wide range of other technologies and protocols that are used to enable communication and data exchange over the internet, including the Domain Name System (DNS), the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and the Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) protocol.
